# üå± Green CDN - Carbon-Aware Load Balancing System

Core: a green (carbon‚Äëaware) load balancer that routes more traffic to cleaner regions.

A complete environment for carbon‚Äëaware load balancing with two complementary paths:

- Real-Time Mode (WattTime API): live carbon intensity drives HAProxy weights now
- Historical Simulation Mode (CSV): replays past data hour-by-hour and actually updates HAProxy weights via the Dataplane API to show how routing would have changed over time

Quick highlights
- HAProxy Dataplane API is used in both modes to set backend weights (higher weight ‚Üí more traffic)
- Historical Simulation includes a dashboard to monitor simulated time, real HAProxy weights, and cumulative carbon saved vs round-robin
- Graphs include clear ‚Äúwhat it shows‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy it matters‚Äù explanations (see below)

What makes it green
- Carbon‚Äëaware weights: lower grid carbon intensity ‚Üí higher HAProxy weight ‚Üí more traffic
- Real data via WattTime (when configured) or historical CSV replay for demos
- Transparent visuals to explain the environmental impact (carbon timeline, weights, cumulative savings)

Historical Simulation (what‚Äôs included now)
- Choose a date range within the CSV coverage (e.g., Dec 2022)
- Pick requests-per-hour and simulation speed (e.g., 2√ó)
- The engine replays the period hour-by-hour, computes carbon-aware weights, applies them to HAProxy, and tracks cumulative carbon savings

Graph meanings (keep these in the UI so it‚Äôs clear)
- Carbon Timeline (demo): hourly carbon intensity for a historical sample; daily cycles; lower values = cleaner periods
- Renewable Energy (demo): historical renewable %; higher renewable share generally aligns with lower carbon intensity
- Regional Comparison (demo): snapshot comparison of regional carbon intensity; highlights cleaner vs dirtier regions at a point in time
- Pattern Analysis (demo): ‚Äútypical day‚Äù curve using hourly averages; this is an average, not a prediction
- Simulation Dashboard: shows actual HAProxy weights (live updates) and cumulative carbon saved vs round-robin (in kg)

Notes to make simulation meaningful
- Normalize timestamps (CSV vs selected dates) to the same timezone (UTC) to avoid ‚Äúoffset-naive vs offset-aware‚Äù errors
- Use larger request totals (e.g., 1000+ per hour) to see clear distribution differences
- Add more charts over time: carbon per region, request distribution over time, weight changes over time

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### Prerequisites
- **Docker Desktop** (required): install for your OS ‚Üí [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **Git** (optional, to clone): [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Make** (optional, Linux/macOS): typically preinstalled; otherwise via your package manager
- Shell: Bash (Linux/macOS) or PowerShell (Windows)

### Step-by-step (Playground)
1) Clone and enter the project directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/greenCDN.git
cd greenCDN
```

2) Create `.env` (demo defaults) and optionally set WattTime credentials
```bash
cp env_example.txt .env
# Then edit .env to add:
# WATTTIME_USERNAME=your_username
# WATTTIME_PASSWORD=your_password
```

3) Start with the helper scripts
- Linux/macOS
```bash
chmod +x scripts/playground.sh
scripts/playground.sh
```
- Windows PowerShell
```powershell
scripts/playground.ps1
```

Alternative: start manually
```bash
# Compose directly
docker-compose up -d

# Or Make (Linux/macOS)
make build && make up
```

4) Access dashboards
- Weight Manager: http://localhost:5000
- Weight Viewer: http://localhost:5001
- HAProxy Stats: http://localhost:8404/stats
- Test Load Balancer: http://localhost:80
- Historical Simulation: http://localhost:5000/historical-simulation

5) Stop / clean up
```bash
docker-compose down
# or
make down
```

### 1. **Setup Environment**
```bash
cp env_example.txt .env
# Edit .env with your WattTime credentials
```

### 2. **Start All Services**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Or use the included helpers:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
scripts/playground.sh

# Windows PowerShell
scripts/playground.ps1

# Make targets (Linux/macOS)
make build
make up
make logs
make down
```

### 3. **Access Dashboards**
- **Weight Manager**: http://localhost:5000
- **Weight Viewer**: http://localhost:5001  
- **HAProxy Stats**: http://localhost:8404/stats
- **Test Load Balancer**: http://localhost:80
 - **Historical Simulation Dashboard**: http://localhost:5000/historical-simulation

## ‚ú® **Features**

### üèÜ **Weight Viewer App (Port 5001)**
- Shows which server currently has the **highest weight**
- Real-time traffic share percentages
- Ranked list of all servers
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Premium glassmorphism UI with live data

### üìä **Integrated HAProxy Dashboard**

## üéØ **How It Works**

### **Carbon-Aware Routing**
1. **WattTime API** provides real-time carbon intensity data
2. **Carbon Controller** fetches data every 5 minutes
3. **Weight Calculator** converts carbon data to HAProxy weights:
   - **Lower carbon = Higher weight = More traffic**
   - **Higher carbon = Lower weight = Less traffic**
4. **HAProxy** routes traffic based on weights
5. **Dashboards** show live results

### **Server Regions**
- **n1**: California (CAISO_NORTH) - **Real WattTime data**
- **n2**: Texas (ERCOT) - **Simulated data** (500 base intensity)
- **n3**: Mid-Atlantic (PJM) - **Simulated data** (700 base intensity)

## üì± **Dashboard Overview**

### **Weight Manager (localhost:5000)**
- üå± **Carbon-Based Updates**: Auto-calculate weights from live carbon data
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Manual Weight Control**: Set individual server weights (1-256)
- **Quick Presets**: Equal, West Heavy, Central Heavy, East Heavy, Reset
- **Live Carbon Display**: See carbon intensity on each server card
- **Dashboard Links**: Direct access to stats and viewer apps
- **Toast Notifications**: Real-time feedback for all updates

### **Weight Viewer (localhost:5001)**
- üèÜ **Traffic Leader**: Shows server with highest weight
- **Ranked List**: All servers sorted by weight
- **Traffic Percentages**: Real-time distribution
- **Auto-Refresh**: Updates every 30 seconds
- **Premium UI**: Clean glassmorphism design with live stats

### **HAProxy Stats (localhost:8404/stats)**
- **Real-time Metrics**: Connections, response times, health
- **Admin Controls**: Enable/disable servers, change weights
- **Historical Data**: Server performance over time
- **Health Monitoring**: Server status and alerts

## üîß **Manual Testing**

### **Test Carbon-Aware Routing**
1. Go to **Weight Manager** (localhost:5000)
2. Click **"üå± Update Carbon Weights"**
3. Watch weights change based on carbon intensity
4. Check **Weight Viewer** (localhost:5001) to see new leader
5. Test actual traffic: `curl http://localhost:80`

### **Test Manual Weight Changes**
1. Set **n1** weight to **200**, others to **50**
2. Check **Weight Viewer** - n1 should be the leader
3. Test traffic distribution with multiple requests
4. View results in **HAProxy Stats**

### **Test Different Presets**
- **Equal** (50/50/50): Balanced distribution
- **West Heavy** (100/30/20): California gets most traffic
- **Central Heavy** (20/100/30): Texas gets most traffic
- **East Heavy** (20/30/100): Mid-Atlantic gets most traffic

## üå± **Carbon Data Sources**

- Updates every 5 minutes
- Actual grid carbon intensity

### **Simulated Data (Texas & Mid-Atlantic)**
- Realistic time-based patterns
- Higher during day, lower at night
- Random variation (¬±20%)
- Baseline: Texas=500, Mid-Atlantic=700 lbs CO2/MWh
